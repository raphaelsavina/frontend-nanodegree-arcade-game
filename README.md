===============================

This is a very easy game...

Install:
Open index.html in your browser and play the game. You could also upload or deploy all the files on a web server of you choice on your local machine (for example with the command "python -m SimpleHTTPServer" in the game directory) or with a web hosting provider.

Aim:
Move your avatar from the grass to the water avoiding collision with the bugs.

If you are touching a bug, you loose and restart at your initial position. If you win, the game restart.

Control:
Use the the arrow key on your keyboard to more your avator on the board: up, down, left and right.
